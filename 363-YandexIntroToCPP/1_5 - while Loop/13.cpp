/*
The Fibonacci sequence is determined by so:
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, ..., F(n) = F(n−1) + F(n−2).
The natural number A is given. Determine what the Fibonacci number is, that is, print the number N that F(N) = A. If A is not a Fibonacci number, print the number -1.

Input data format
The natural number A > 1 is introduced.

Output Format
Display the answer to the problem.
